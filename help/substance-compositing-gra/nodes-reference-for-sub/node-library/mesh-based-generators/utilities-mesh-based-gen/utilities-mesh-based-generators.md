# Utilities (Mesh Based Generators)

These nodes are more abstract tools to help you work with mesh adaptive nodes. In some cases, their functionality closely ties into [Material Filters](../../../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/material-filters/material-filters.md) as well.

There are only a few nodes in this category, so make sure to check them all out.
