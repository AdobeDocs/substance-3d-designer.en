# Effects

This category contains a large variety of nodes intended for multiple uses. These nodes are mainly intended for a single channel input and perform a fairly advanced effect or modification as output.

Use the <b>navigation list on the left</b> to browse all nodes under Effects.

A large group of nodes is intended for processing, generating and modifying Baked maps, such as Normalmap or AO and Curvature. Examples are:

* [Curvature Smooth](../../../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/filters/effects/curvature-smooth/curvature-smooth.md)
* [Ambient Occlusion (HBAO)](../../../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/filters/effects/ambient-occlusion-hbao/ambient-occlusion-hbao-filter-node.md)

Another group of nodes is intended for layer shape effect or "Layer Styles", as seen in other popular image editing software. Examples are:

* [Glow](../../../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/filters/effects/glow/glow.md)
* [Shape Stroke](../../../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/filters/effects/shape-stroke/shape-stroke.md)
* [Uber Emboss](../../../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/filters/effects/uber-emboss/uber-emboss.md)

Finally, there are some useful advanced effects, of which [Flood Fill](../../../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/filters/effects/flood-fill/flood-fill.md), [Edge Detect](../../../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/filters/effects/edge-detect/edge-detect.md) and [Vector Warp](../../../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/filters/effects/vector-warp/vector-warp.md) are the best examples.
