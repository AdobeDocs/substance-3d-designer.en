# Filters

Filters are nodes that process an input to create a modified, "filtered" output, in a way you might be used to from other well-known imaging applications. The big difference with [Material Filters](../../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/material-filters/material-filters.md) is that they only work on one (sometimes more) inputs that do not represent a full material.

Filters are one of the most used major categories. Apart from the [Atomic nodes](../../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/atomic-nodes/atomic-nodes.md) category, no other category is as useful when building textures from scratch. Take the time to get to know each of the subcategories:

* [Adjustments](../../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/filters/adjustments/adjustments.md)  
  Expanded color, tone and value adjustments.
* [Blending](../../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/filters/blending/blending.md)  
  Advanced and expanded blending modes.
* [Blurs](../../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/filters/blurs/blurs.md)  
  Advanced, high-quality blurs.
* [Channels](../../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/filters/channels/channels.md)  
  Expanded Channel-mixing nodes.
* [Effects](../../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/filters/effects/effects.md)  
  Texturing-oriented image effects, as well as "Layer Style"-type effects.
* [Normal Map](../../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/filters/normal-map/normal-map.md)  
  Normal Map focused operations.
* [Tiling](../../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/filters/tiling/tiling.md)  
  Nodes focused on fixing and improving tiling.
* [Transforms](../../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/filters/transforms/transforms.md)  
  Advanced (mathematical) 2D-space transformation operations.
