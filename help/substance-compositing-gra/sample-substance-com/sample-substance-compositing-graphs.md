# Sample Substance graphs

## Overview

This page lists sample [Substance 3D Designer](https://www.adobe.com/products/substance3d-designer.html) files available to download. These projects include annotated graphs which present fundamental tools and concepts of [Substance graphs](../../compositing-graphs/substance-compositing-graphs.md).

## Filters

This project features a simple graph setup to be used as a filter in other graphs. [Filters](../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/filters/filters.md) are nodes which modify and/or blend one or more input images.

## Inheritance

This project demonstrates the inheritance methods available in Substance graphs to propagate important image information such as resolution and bitdepth across nodes in a graph.

You can learn about inheritance in [this page](../../compositing-graphs/inheritance-compositing/inheritance-in-substance-compositing-graphs.md) of our documentation.

## Pixel Processor

The [Pixel processor](../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/atomic-nodes/pixel-processor/pixel-processor.md) node is one of the most complex yet powerful nodes in Designer, and understanding its workings unlocks a significant amount of power and flexibility in your graphs, which enables you to create more varied custom nodes.

This project demonstrates two simple uses cases for the Pixel processor: as a generator and a a filter. It is also a stepping stone to doing more with [function graphs](../../function-graphs/function-graphs.md).
