# Blending (Material)

The Blending category is one of the most important multi-channel material categories. It contains nodes intended for combining, switching and blending materials that consist of multiple simultaneous outputs.

These nodes can save massive amounts of work, but make sure you fully understand [Link Creation Modes](../../../../../interface/the-graph-view/link-creation-modes/link-creation-modes.md) to properly utilise them.

The following nodes are good ones to start with:

* [Multi-Material Blend](multi-material-blend/multi-material-blend.md)
* [Material Adjustment Blend](material-adjustment-blend/material-adjustment-blend.md)
