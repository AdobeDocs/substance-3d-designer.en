# PBR Utilities

This category contains helper nodes for working with PBR materials. It's intended for use with both Specular-Glossiness as well as Metallic-Roughness PBR workflows. All nodes are intended for multi channel-materials, and channels can be (de)activated to support one or both worfklows.

The following nodes are especially useful:

* [Base Material](../../../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/material-filters/pbr-utilities/base-material/base-material.md)
* [PBR BaseColor / Metallic Validate](../../../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/material-filters/pbr-utilities/pbr-basecolor-metallic/pbr-basecolor-metallic-validate.md)
* [PBR Render](../../../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/material-filters/pbr-utilities/pbr-render/pbr-render.md)
