# Material Filters

Material Filters are nodes that work with Full Material inputs: combinations of multiple channels, best used through [Link Creation Modes](../../../../interface/the-graph-view/link-creation-modes/link-creation-modes.md). Any time you are working with a full PBR material and not just a single channel such as Basecolor or Normal, or a simple black and white mask, you will want to use the Material Filters category.

This category consists of a number of sub-categories:

* [1-Click](../../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/material-filters/1-click/1-click.md)  
  Only contains Bitmap2Material.
* [Effects](../../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/material-filters/effects-material/effects-material.md)  
  Fancy, all-in-one material effects.
* [Transforms](../../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/material-filters/transforms-material/transforms-material.md)  
  Multi-channel transformation helpers.
* [Blending](../../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/material-filters/blending-material/blending-material.md)  
  Multi-channel blend nodes.
* [PBR Utilities](../../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/material-filters/pbr-utilities/pbr-utilities.md)  
  PBR helper nodes and tools.
* [Scan Processing](../../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/material-filters/scan-processing/scan-processing.md)  
  Tools specifically intended for photoscanned textures.
