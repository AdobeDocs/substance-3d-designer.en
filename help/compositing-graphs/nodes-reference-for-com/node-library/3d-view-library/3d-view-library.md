# 3D View (Library)

The 3D View category contains only nodes related to spherical projected HDRI's, either those used in the 3D View of Substance 3D Designer, or for exporting to other applications such as Substance 3D Painter.

There are two subcategories:

* **HDRI Environments**: No documentation is available, as these are purely images meant for display in the 3D View, with no additional parameters.
* **HDRI Tools**: tool nodes for creating and editing spherical HDRI images. Introduced in SD 2019.2.
