# Filters

Filters are nodes that process an input to create a modified, "filtered" output, in a way you might be used to from other well-known imaging applications. The big difference with [Material Filters](../material-filters/material-filters.md) is that they only work on one (sometimes more) inputs that do not represent a full material.

Filters are one of the most used major categories. Apart from the [Atomic nodes](../../atomic-nodes/atomic-nodes.md) category, no other category is as useful when building textures from scratch. Take the time to get to know each of the subcategories:

* [Adjustments](adjustments/adjustments.md)  
  Expanded color, tone and value adjustments.
* [Blending](blending/blending.md)  
  Advanced and expanded blending modes.
* [Blurs](blurs/blurs.md)  
  Advanced, high-quality blurs.
* [Channels](channels/channels.md)  
  Expanded Channel-mixing nodes.
* [Effects](effects/effects.md)  
  Texturing-oriented image effects, as well as "Layer Style"-type effects.
* [Normal Map](normal-map/normal-map.md)  
  Normal Map focused operations.
* [Tiling](tiling/tiling.md)  
  Nodes focused on fixing and improving tiling.
* [Transforms](transforms/transforms.md)  
  Advanced (mathematical) 2D-space transformation operations.

> A project file demonstrating a simple setup for a *custom* filter is available in the [Sample Substance compositing graphs](../../../sample-compositing-graphs/sample-substance-compositing-graphs.md) section of this documentation.
