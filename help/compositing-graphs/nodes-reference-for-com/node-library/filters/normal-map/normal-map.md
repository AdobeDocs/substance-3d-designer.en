# Normal Map

This category only contains nodes for processing and working with Normalmaps. They are an absolute must when you want your Normalmap processing to be mathematically correct, to avoid any Tangent-space issues.

Use the <b>navigation list on the left</b> to browse all nodes under Normal Map.

Some very useful nodes in this category are:

* [Normal Combine](normal-combine/normal-combine.md)
* [Normal Sobel](normal-sobel/normal-sobel.md)
* [Normal Normalize](normal-normalize/normal-normalize.md)
