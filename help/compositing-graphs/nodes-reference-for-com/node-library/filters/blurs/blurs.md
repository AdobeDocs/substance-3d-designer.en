# Blurs

The Blurs category expands on [the standard, atomic Box Blur node](../../../atomic-nodes/blur/blur.md). It contains more advanced, higher-quality Blurs that have multiple uses.

Keep in mind that every Library Blur node comes in a Grayscale and Color version. Try to use the version that is appropriate for your input!

Some good Blurs to check out:

* [Blur HQ](blur-hq/blur-hq.md)
* [Slope Blur](slope-blur/slope-blur.md)
