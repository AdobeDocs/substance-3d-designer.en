# Effects

This category contains a large variety of nodes intended for multiple uses. These nodes are mainly intended for a single channel input and perform a fairly advanced effect or modification as output.

Use the <b>navigation list on the left</b> to browse all nodes under Effects.

A large group of nodes is intended for processing, generating and modifying Baked maps, such as Normalmap or AO and Curvature. Examples are:

* [Curvature Smooth](curvature-smooth/curvature-smooth.md)
* [Ambient Occlusion (HBAO)](ambient-occlusion-hbao/ambient-occlusion-hbao-filter-node.md)

Another group of nodes is intended for layer shape effect or "Layer Styles", as seen in other popular image editing software. Examples are:

* [Glow](glow/glow.md)
* [Shape Stroke](shape-stroke/shape-stroke.md)
* [Uber Emboss](uber-emboss/uber-emboss.md)

Finally, there are some useful advanced effects, of which [Flood Fill](flood-fill/flood-fill.md), [Edge Detect](edge-detect/edge-detect.md) and [Vector Warp](vector-warp/vector-warp.md) are the best examples.
