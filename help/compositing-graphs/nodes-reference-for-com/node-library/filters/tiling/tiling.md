# Tiling

The tiling category contains nodes used for improving the tiling of textures. Keep in mind that there are other nodes available for this in [Scan Processing](../../material-filters/scan-processing/scan-processing.md).

Use the navigation list on the left to browse all nodes under <b>Tiling</b>.

There are two nodes in this category:

* [Make It Tile Patch](make-it-tile-patch/make-it-tile-patch.md)
* [Make It Tile Photo](make-it-tile-photo/make-it-tile-photo.md)
