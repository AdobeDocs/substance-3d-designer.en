# Channels

Since connections in Designer can be full color RGB or single value grayscale, this category allows you to split, merge and mix these channels.

The following nodes can help you get started:

* [Alpha Merge](../../../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/filters/channels/alpha-merge/alpha-merge.md)
* [RGBA Split](../../../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/filters/channels/rgba-split/rgba-split.md)
