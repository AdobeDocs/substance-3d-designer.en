# Weathering

Weathering nodes take [Mask Generators](../../../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/mesh-based-generators/mask-generators/mask-generators.md) ones step further: they do a full-material weathering effect based on parameters and baked maps. The concept is very similar to [Smart Materials](https://helpx.adobe.com/substance-3d-painter/features/smart-materials-and-masks.html) in Substance Painter.

You need to have one or more baked maps to get a full result out of these nodes.

Keep in mind that because these nodes offer such all-encompassing, complete effects, their usage is limited to only some cases. However, they can also be a good base for learning how such complex effects are built. Drag the nodes from the library into the Explorer, or right-click and choose "Open Reference" on a node placed in the graph.
