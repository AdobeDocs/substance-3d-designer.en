# Mask Generators

This category contains a selection of black-and-white mask-generating nodes. Based on baked map information, they generate masks that can then be used to blend together materials and other effects. These nodes are similar to [Smart Masks](https://helpx.adobe.com/substance-3d-painter/features/smart-materials-and-masks.html) and [Generators](https://helpx.adobe.com/substance-3d-painter/content/creating-custom-effects/generators.html) in Substance Painter.

All of these nodes require [baked maps,](../../../../../bakers/bakers.md) as without [baked maps](../../../../../bakers/bakers.md) there won't be much of a result.

The main intended usage is to use these mask generators with [multi-channels materials](../../../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/material-filters/material-filters.md). Once a mask is generated, it is used as the blend mask for [Material Blend](../../../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/material-filters/blending-material/material-blend/material-blend.md).

Some interesting nodes in this category are:

* [Dripping Rust](../../../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/mesh-based-generators/mask-generators/dripping-rust/dripping-rust.md)
* [Edge Damages](../../../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/mesh-based-generators/mask-generators/edge-damages/edge-damages.md)
* [Bottom To Top](../../../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/mesh-based-generators/mask-generators/bottom-to-top/bottom-to-top.md)
* [Mask Builder](../../../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/mesh-based-generators/mask-generators/mask-builder/mask-builder.md)
