# Noises

Noises are organic, chaotic looking procedural graphics. The outputs generated by noises look very different from the artificial-looking shapes of the [Patterns category.](../patterns/patterns.md)

You would use noises in [Substance 3D Designer](https://www.adobe.com/products/substance3d-designer.html) as a starting point or detail layer for things like grit, dirt, random growth, for any kind of subtle-variation layering, etc...

All noises are fully resolution-independent, so you can scale up or down your result without any fear of ever losing quality.

There are 3 different use groups inside the Noises category:

* The large majority are the standard noises, that spread a wide spectrum and are useful in many cases.
* Grunge maps are compound noises with much more depth and details than standard noises, at the cost of a much slower computation speed.
* 3D noises that require at least a baked position map from a mesh, they are intended for very specific use cases.

Use the <b>navigation list on the left</b> to browse all nodes under Noises.

Some good noises to start with:

* [Perlin noise](perlin-noise/perlin-noise.md)
* [Clouds 2](clouds-2/clouds-2.md)
* [Fractal sum base](fractal-sum-base/fractal-sum-base.md)
* [Cells 4](cells-4/cells-4.md)
