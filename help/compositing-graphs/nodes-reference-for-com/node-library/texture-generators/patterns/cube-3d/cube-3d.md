## Description

Renders a grayscale 3D cube with shading that also serves as screen-depth. The resulting cube has super-sharp and crisp edges when used with high precision bit-depths. Very interesting and useful!

## Parameters

* **Orientation Offset**:   
  Allows for 3D-like X- and Y-rotation of the cube. Can also be done by manipulating the small dot in the 2D preview (as shown on the example below)
* **Size**: *0.0 - 1.0*Allows for non-uniform rescaling of the cube.
* **Scale**: *0.0 - 1.0*  
  Rescales entire cube uniformly.
* **Non Square Expansion**: *False/True*  
  Enables compensation of squash and stretch with non-square ratios.
