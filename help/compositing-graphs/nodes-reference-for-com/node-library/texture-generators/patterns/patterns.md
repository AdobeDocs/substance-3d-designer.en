# Patterns

Patterns are artificial graphics that look man-made. They mostly follow rules for their placement, but random variation can be introduced most of the time.

They are useful for when you want a regular pattern as base, such as bricks, tiles, woven patterns, etc.

Almost all patterns tile perfectly and are resolution-independent, meaning you can rescale them without loss of quality.

Use the <b>navigation list on the left</b> to browse all nodes under Patterns.

Some good patterns to start with are:

* [Shape](../../../../../help/compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/texture-generators/patterns/shape/shape.md)
* [Polygon 2](../../../../../help/compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/texture-generators/patterns/polygon-2/polygon-2.md)
* [Tile generator](../../../../../help/compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/texture-generators/patterns/tile-generator/tile-generator.md)
* [Tile random 2](../../../../../help/compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/texture-generators/patterns/tile-random-2/tile-random-2.md)
* [Shape mapper](../../../../../help/compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/texture-generators/patterns/shape-mapper/shape-mapper.md)
* [Shape extrude](../../../../../help/compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/texture-generators/patterns/shape-extrude/shape-extrude.md)
