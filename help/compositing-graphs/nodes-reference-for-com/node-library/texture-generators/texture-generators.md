# Texture generators

Texture generators are nodes that do not require any inputs: they generate images completely from scratch. You can think of 'texture generators' as another word for 'procedurals'.

They are split into two categories:

* [Noises](../../../../help/compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/texture-generators/noises/noises.md)  
  Noises are the true procedural graphics, random shapes and pixels, like well-known Perlin and Clouds noises.
* [Patterns](../../../../help/compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/texture-generators/patterns/patterns.md)  
  Patterns are mostly shapes that look man-made, with many additional controls to randomise them.
