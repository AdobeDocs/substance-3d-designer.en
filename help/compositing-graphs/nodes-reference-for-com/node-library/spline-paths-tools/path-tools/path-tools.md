# Path tools

Path tools are a collection of nodes for generating and adjusting paths, as well as converting them to splines for complex scattering or warping of images.

Paths are a series of points connected into straight lines.

Check out this tutorial to get started:

>[!TIP]
>
> We recommend learning about [working with Path and Spline tools](../working-with-path-and-spl/working-with-path-and-spline-tools.md) to make the most of the toolset.
> 
> For advanced users, the [Paths Format Specification](paths-format-spe/paths-format-specifications.md) explains how the data of paths is encoded into color images, and provides tips for manipulating this data directly.
