# Spline &amp; Path Tools

Spline &amp; Path Tools are a collection of nodes for working with paths and splines in Substance graphs:

<b>Paths</b> are a series of points connected into straight lines.

<b>Splines</b> are smooth curves whose trajectories are shaped by control points and those points' tangents. Each point also controls a spline's height and thickness attributes which are used to drive the mapping, warping and scattering of images.

This category holds the following sub-categories:

* [Spline tools](../../../../help/compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/spline-paths-tools/spline-tools/spline-tools.md)  
  Nodes for generating and ajusting splines, as well as using them for mapping, scattering or warping images.
* [Path tools](../../../../help/compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/spline-paths-tools/path-tools/path-tools.md)Nodes for generating and adjusting paths, as well as converting them to splines for complex scattering or warping of images.
