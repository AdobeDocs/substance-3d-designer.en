# Spline tools

Spline tools are a collection of nodes for generating and adjusting splines, as well as using them for mapping, scattering or warping images.

Splines are smooth curves whose trajectories are shaped by control points and those points' tangents. Each point also controls a spline's height and thickness attributes which are used to drive the mapping, warping and scattering of images.
