# Material samples

![Material samples - Template cards](materialSamples-cards.png "Material samples - Template cards")

Designer offers a curated selection of sample graphs spanning various materials types to learn from and experiment with.

The samples are meant to be used as a graph template, which means are accessed by <b>creating a new Substance graph</b>. The new graph is a <b>fully editable copy</b> of the sample, which you may edit, take apart and expand on as you like. You can create as many new graphs as you like out of the samples.

When creating a new Substance graph, you will find the samples in the [New Substance graph dialog](../../../compositing-graphs/creating-compositing-gra/creating-a-substance-compositing-graph.md):

<table>
<tr style="border: 0;">
<td style="border: 0;" valign="top">

Open the <b>Category</b> combobox and select <b>Material samples</b> to list the available templates.

You can go directly to the list of samples in the dialog, by using the <b>Go to samples</b> button conveniently placed in the <b>Home screen</b>.

<table>
<tr style="border: 0;">
<td width="33.33%" style="border: 0;" valign="top">

In the dialog, hover the information icon of a sample item to get more information about the concepts and techniques explored in the sample.

<td width="100.00%" style="border: 0;" valign="top">

Double-click any item to create a new graph out of that sample. You may also select the sample and click the <b>Create</b> button.

Double-click any item to create a new graph out of that sample. You may also select the sample and click the <b>Create</b> button. Once a material sample is selected and the graph creation validated, the dialog closes and a copy of the sample is loaded as a new graph in the Graph view.

By default, the first output of the sample is loaded in the 2D View, and the textures are applied to the 3D View. So your workspace is automatically set up and you are ready to go. (This can be changed in Designer's [preferences](../../../interface/preferences-window/preferences-window.md))
