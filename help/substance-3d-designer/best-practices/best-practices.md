# Best Practices

In specific areas it makes sense to pay extra attention regarding organisation, efficiency, performance and filesize. This section covers a few of these specific cases

## Filesize Reduction Guidelines

In some cases the total filesize of Substance 3D assets (SBSAR) can be an important factor. This page covers a few critical areas and settings to keep in mind when trying to reduce filesize.

## Graph Creation Etiquette

Creating large, complex graphs can quickly get confusing and become hard to navigate. A number of tools can be used to alleviate these issues, and there are some good habits to get in to, to avoid issues later on. This page provides a conclusive list of techniques we recommend using for clean, efficient, functional Graphs that are easily shared and understood.
