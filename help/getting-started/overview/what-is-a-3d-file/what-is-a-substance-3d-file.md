# What is a Substance 3D File?

![Parametric brick wall material](MaterialsOverview.gif "Parametric brick wall material")

*Example of brick wall material made by Käy Vriend.  
Parameters can be changed to dynamically control the material's appearance.*

A Substance 3D file is a dynamic texture(s) generator, that can be used directly in many applications.

It is dynamic because contrary to a classic bitmap file, the creator of a Substance 3D file can choose to <b>expose parameters</b> in order to give <b>control</b> of the final result that will be generated.

For example, it is possible to change the amount of dust on an object, or the color of a soccer team jersey. Your talent and your imagination are the only limits to what you can do.

A Substance material can be published, then used in <b>external application</b> that integrate the <b>Substance 3D Engine</b> (such as *Unity* or *Unreal Engine*).

Substance 3D materials can be *100% procedural*, therefore their output size will be very light.
