# Texture generators

Texture generators are nodes that do not require any inputs: they generate images completely from scratch. You can think of 'texture generators' as another word for 'procedurals'.

They are split into two categories:

* [Noises](noises/noises.md)  
  Noises are the true procedural graphics, random shapes and pixels, like well-known Perlin and Clouds noises.
* [Patterns](patterns/patterns.md)  
  Patterns are mostly shapes that look man-made, with many additional controls to randomise them.
