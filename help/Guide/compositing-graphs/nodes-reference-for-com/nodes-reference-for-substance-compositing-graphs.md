# Nodes reference for Substance graphs

As Substance 3D Designer is a node based texturing software, there are many different nodes at your disposal. This section aims to explain the different types and document all nodes supplied with the software.

What we call "node" inside SD, can be divided into 2 mains groups:

* [The atomic nodes](atomic-nodes/atomic-nodes.md), the core building blocks of any graph.
* [The graph instances](../creating-compositing-gra/graph-instances-sub-gra/graph-instances-sub-graphs.md), compound nodes, of which a large selection of premade content is available in the [Node library](node-library/node-library.md)
