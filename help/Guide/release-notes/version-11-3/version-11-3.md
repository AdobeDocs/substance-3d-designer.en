# Version 11.3

**Substance 3D Designer**

Release date: *24 November 2021*

## Major feature

### New model graph functionalities

![](banner-model.jpg)

A lot of improvements have been added to the model graph to expand the modeling capabilities:

* <b>New particle workflow</b>  
  The new particle modeling workflow allow to create clouds of point to manipulate geometry. They can be used to create a lot of new complex and/or repetitive shapes such as the roof tiles on the image just above.  
  To learn more about the new particle workflow, see the following documentation pages:

  * Types of Items in a scene
  * Particles
  * Particle pruning
  * Particles from instances

* <b>New modeling and deformation nodes</b>  
  Additional new nodes have added to create more complex shapes, click on each node to learn mroe about them:
  * Generative transform
  * Organic pattern
  * Lathe
  * Curve trim

* <b>General improvements  
  </b>The workflow around the modeling graph has been improved with:
  * New tooltips on nodes parameters to make them easier to learn.
  * The 3D model hierarchy is now preserved when exporting in FBX
  * Material assignation can be exported with the OBJ and FBX file formats.
  * Preview intermediate nodes in the viewport in overlay mode.

### Improved interoperability

![](banner-sendto.jpg)

The send-o actions have been expanded, with two new possibilities:

* **Send SBSM (substance model file) to Stager**   
  Procedural 3D models can now be sent to Stager and be modified from there with the exposed parameters.

* **Receive SBS/SBSAR from Sampler**   
  It is now possible to receive Substance files generated by Sampler directly into Designer.

### Miscellaneous

![](banner-misc-3.jpg)

Various quality of life improvements have been made:

* **Inputs relative to inputs**   
  Graph inputs set in Relative to inputs will now inherit the connected node size instead of default to the parent graph size. This makes managing different resolutions via inputs of different sizes much easier.

* **New graph window**   
  The new graph window has been reworked and now allow to better see the details of a specific template and to create new graph directly into an existing package.

* **Close All Packages**   
  A small action which makes less tedious to manage many packages in the explorer. Use **File** &gt; **Close all** to close all the currently opened packages.

* **Maximize Current View**   
  Use the new title bar **icon** or the shortcut **SHIFT+Space** to expand a window to the full screen. This can be used on floating window as well.

* **3D view improvements**   
  The 3D view has new display settings to toggle the display of back faces on a 3D model as well the display of Vertices, Tangent and Bitangents.

### Content

This releases add new diffusion nodes and improvements for the PBR Render node:

* <b>Diffusion nodes</b>  
  The new Diffusion Color, Diffusion Grayscale and Diffusion UV nodes allow to generate soft bleeding blurs based on an input mask.

* **Improved PBR render node**   
  This node had the following changes:
  * New cubic UV mode for the Sphere shape.
  * New support for Subsurface scattering.
  * Anisotropy now follows the Adobe Strand Material 5ASM) model.
  * Image based lighting has been improved with the support of importance sampling.
  * Emissive lighting has been improved with the support of importance sampling.
