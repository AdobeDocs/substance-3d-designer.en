# Resources

Resources are the content of Substance 3D Designer's packages. They are used to build, generate and preview material and texture data. Resources can be split into two major categories: Graph resources and non-Graph resources. The method used to create or import Resources differ between types, you can read the dedicated page about [Linking, Importing and New Resources](../help/resources/importing-linking-and-new/importing-linking-and-new-resources.md) to better understand this.

## Graph resources

Graph Resources are the main resources created inside Designer. Each have their own dedicated areas in the documentation. Three major types exist:

* [Substance graphs](../help/compositing-graphs/substance-compositing-graphs.md)
* [Function graphs](../help/function-graphs/function-graphs.md)
* [MDL Graphs](../help/mdl-graphs/mdl-graphs.md)

### NON-GRAPH RESOURCES

Non Graph Resources are usually helper resources used as additional data in Graphs, or to help visualize results from Graphs. The following types exist, each have a subpage in this section of the docs:

* [Bitmap](../help/resources/bitmap-resource/bitmap-resource.md)
* [Vector Graphics (SVG)](../help/resources/vector-graphics-svg-res/vector-graphics-svg-resource.md)
* [3D scene resource](https://helpx.adobe.com/substance-3d/unlisted/documentation/sddoc/3d-mesh-resource-200574577.html)
* [Font](../help/resources/font-resource/font-resource.md)
