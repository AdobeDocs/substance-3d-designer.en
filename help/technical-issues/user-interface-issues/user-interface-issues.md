Designer acquires the specific scale of user interface elements *from the OS*. Therefore any adjustments to the scaling of the user interface should be done in the display settings of the OS.

To ensure display settings are applied correctly in Designer, *sign out* of your OS user session and sign back in after changing these settings.
