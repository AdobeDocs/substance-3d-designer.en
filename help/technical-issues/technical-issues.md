## Report an issue

Designer includes ways of reporting crashes and bugs directly.

>[!TIP]
>
> Please be descriptive!
> 
> *Every* crash and bug report that you send us *will be* reviewed by a member of the Designer team.
> 
> When reporting an issue, <b>please include as many details and context you can</b>, this makes it significantly easier and faster to understand the issue and find a solution for it.
> 
> If you have any feedback or suggestions for improving Designer, please let us know in [our dedicated forum](https://community.adobe.com/t5/substance-3d-designer/ct-p/ct-substance-3d-designer). The community can upvote suggestions and we track that information.

### Crash report

<table>
<tr style="border: 0;">
<td style="border: 0;" valign="top">

When the application crashes, in most cases the Crash Report dialog is displayed.

You can let us know about the circumstances of the crash in the Description field so we can investigate it and hopefully fix it in a future Designer release.

Share a <b>valid e-mail address</b> so we can reach out to you if we need more details and/or can provide a workaround for the crash you experienced.

> Crash reports include Designer's log file, preferences and project files *by default*. As such, some <b>system and file paths may appear</b> in these files.
> 
> The use of these files is <b>strictly internal and limited</b> to the scope of investigating the reported issue.
