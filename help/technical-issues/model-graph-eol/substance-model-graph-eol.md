# Substance model graph feature is missing

## End of life

Substance model graphs were our first foray into parametric modelling and were later <b>retired</b> in version <b>13.0.0</b> of Substance 3D Designer.

Version <b>12.4.1</b> is the *last* version of Designer with support for Substance model graphs. Users of that feature should therefore not update to higher versions.
