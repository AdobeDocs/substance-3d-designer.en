# Version 2019.2 (9.2)

**Substance Designer 2019.2** delivers the new Dot node, HDR filters and strong optimizations.

## Major Features

### New Dot Node

![](header-dot-node.png)

The Dot node is a long awaited request. Its purpose it to redirect connections between nodes to reorganize your graph. Contrary to our previous redirection dot, this one can accumulate links and doesn't disappear when its connections are broken.

To read more about the Dot Node, see the [Graph items](../../../help/interface/the-graph-view/graph-items/graph-items.md) page.

### Improved Node Creation Menu

![](header-favorites.png)

The Node Creation menu which appears when pressing "spacebar" can now define and list in priority your favorites. Some new behaviors around the menu have been added as well to make it easier to use.

* **Display favorites first**   
  When clicking on the icon next to the text field, you can enable or disable the listing of favorites first.

  ![](favoite-display.gif)
* **Add or Remove favorites**   
  When favorites are displayed, you can add or remove nodes in the list by clicking on the icon next to the node name.  
  (Favorites can also be managed directly in the Library window.)

  ![](add-remove-favorites.gif)
* **Open the menu when click and dragging a link from a node**   
  When click and dragging the connection of a node and releasing the mouse it will now open the Node Creation menu. The node created will then be connected to the link. The nodes available in the list will be dependent of the incoming connection. ![](click-drag-insert-node.gif)

### New Techniques for Realtime Renderer

![](header-opengl.jpg)

The realtime viewport of Substance Designer has been improved to support new rendering features: **Anisotropy**, **Coating** and **Subsurface Scattering**. All the new channels and usages introduced by these features are compatible with Iray as well.

* **Anisotropy**   
  Anisotropy is a property that defines how a reflection should behave in a given direction. It is often used for specific material types such as hair and brushed metals.  
  To create an Anisotropic material you need two outputs in your graph with the following usages:

  * **AnisotropyAngle**: Defines the anisotropy direction. Goes from black to white to loop.
  * **AnisotropyLevel**: Defines the anisotropy intensity. Recommended values are 0.9 to 0.98 (grayscale).

  Note: Anisotropy is supported by all our default PBR shaders.

  ![](coating-anisotropy-disc-0.jpg){width="400px"}
* **Coating**   
  Coating allow to define a second layer of material above the base material. It can be used to simulate car paint or films on metallic surfaces.  
  To create a Coated material you can use the new Substance template "PBR Coated (Metallic/Roughness)" or add the following outputs in your graph:

  * **coatWeight**: Opacity of the coating layer.
  * **coatSpecularLevel**: Specular Level for the coating layer.
  * **coatColor**: Color of the coating layer.
  * **coatNormal**: Normal for the coating layer.
  * **coatRoughness**: Roughness for the coating layer.

  Note: Coating requires the new shader "physically\_metallic\_roughness\_coated".

  ![](coating-carbon-fiber-0.jpg){width="400px"}
* **Subsurface Scattering**   
  Subsurface scattering simulate the absorption and diffusion of light inside a material. It is very useful for simulating skin and other organic surfaces.  
  To create a Subsurface material you can use the new Substance template "PBR Sub-Surface Scattering (Metallic/Roughness)" or add the following output to your graph :

  * **scattering**: Controls the intensity of the diffusion of light inside the material.

  Note: Subsurface requires the new shader "physically\_metallic\_roughness\_sss" . The scattering color can be controlled in the shader parameters.

>[!NOTE]
>
> All these new rendering features are possible thanks to a rework of the shader system of Substance Designer. Our **GLSLFX** format now supports the definition of "**Techniques**" which allows multiple pass of rendering. For some examples take a look at our default shaders available in : **Substance Designer/resources/view3d/shaders**

### Improved Performances

![](library-loading-optim.gif)

Several improvements to the Substance engine (which jumps to version 7.2.0) have been made which are beneficial in several situations:

* **Caching of graph computations for faster tweaking**  
  Graph rendering has been improved with the addition of a new caching system. This make tweaking a graph much faster than before because we now skip unchanged nodes.
* **Improved Library loading time**  
  The loading of the library has been greatly improved thanks to the new cooking optimizations and decoding speed improvements. The library is now 2 to 8 times faster to generate.

### New Content with HDR Filters

![](header-hdr-filters.jpg)

With this new release we introduce a lot of new filters dedicated to the manipulation of HDR environment maps.

* **HDR Merge**:Bring together several LDR (Low Dynamic Range) photos to create one HDR image.
* **Nadir Patch**:This node allows you to clone/patch the ground part of an HDRI while taking the spherical deformation into account.
* **Nadir Extract**: This node is can extracting a texture out of an HDRI. It can be used to map a ground texture in a 3D scene.
* **Color Temperature Adjustment**: Adjust the color temperature of an input image, including the support of HDR values.
* **Straighten Horizon**: Rotate the latitude/longitude of an environment map. Depending on the shooting conditions, the resulting 360° panorama might not be straight.
* **Physical Sun&amp;Sky**: This node is an implementation of the Hosek-Wilkie Skylight model. Specify the sun position and it will generate a physically accurate sky panorama.
* **Plane Light**: Generate a rectangular light as if it was a 3D shape. You can change its position in the 2D view, apply a texture and set the color using a temperature or RGB value.
* **Line Light**: Generate a line-shaped light, and change its position in the 2D view. It has similar options to the Plane light except that it is designed for thin long shapes like neon lights.
* **Sphere Light**: Generate a sphere-shaped light, and change its position using the 2D View gizmo. You can also apply a spherical texture to create distant planets.

All new [HDRI Tools](../../../help/compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/3d-view-library/hdri-tools/hdri-tools.md) are documented in the [Node Library section](../../../help/compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/node-library.md).
