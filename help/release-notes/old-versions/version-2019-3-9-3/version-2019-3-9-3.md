# Version 2019.3 (9.3)

**Substance Designer 2019.3** introduces Color Management with support of OpenColorIO as well as improved bakers updates and a new atlas scatter node.

Release date: *December 19, 2019*

## Major Features

### Color Management and OpenColorIO support

![](banner-color-management.jpg)

Substance Designer now supports color management, which allows to control how colors are interpreted and transformed. This feature comes with the support for [OpenColorIO](https://opencolorio.org/), which is a widely used color management system used in the Entertainment and VFX industry.

* **Setting up color management in the main settings**  
  By default Substance Designer will be set in "legacy" mode meaning it won't load any specific configuration and will continue to work as before. To switch to OpenColorIO for example, simply heads-up to the main settings and then in the project settings to configure and enable it.

* **Color Management is applied in 3 different ways**  
  Different parts of the application receive the color management which have different implications:

  * **2D and 3D View**  
    Both the Real-time opengl viewport and Iray can be color managed. This allows to preview in context the material and texturing. The color profile can be easily switched via the dedicated dropdown. It is also possible to display the view in Linear Gamma to preview without color correction.

  * **Graph Inputs and Outputs and bitmap export**  
    When reading and writing bitmap images at the entry and exit of a graph, the color management can adjust the image and convert them to work in the right conditions. This can be controlled in the main preference for bitmap in the graph and modified in the export dialog during the export process. Saving an image from the 2D View will also offer a way to choose the color space.

### New Curvature from Mesh Baker

![](banner-curvature-1.png)

The Curvature from mesh baker has been remade from scratch. It now takes advantage of raytracing which allows GPU acceleration but also adds the support of mesh intersections.

For more information see the [Curvature from Mesh](https://helpx.adobe.com/substance-3d-bake/bakers-settings/curvature-from-mesh.html) documentation.

>[!NOTE]
>
> The previous Curvature from mesh baker is now deprecated. We recommend switching to the new version.

### Improved Ambient Occlusion from Mesh Baker

![](banner-ao-v2.png)

The Ambient Occlusion From Mesh baker now has a new setting named "Ground Plane" which simulates a plane under the mesh to produce ground occlusion. This can help produce more interesting looking result for static geometry or non-organic objects. The Ground Plane sits at the bottom of the mesh bounding box by default but can be pushed further with a dedicated settings.

For more information see the [Ambient Occlusion from Mesh](https://helpx.adobe.com/substance-3d-bake/bakers-settings/ambient-occlusion-from-mesh.html) documentation.

### Improved Properties and Preset Editor

![](banner-presets.png)

The properties editor has been improved as well as the preset editor:

* **Faster preview mode**  
  Switching to the preview mode when editing graph parameters is now much faster, especially on graphs with a lot of exposed parameters. The preview mode is now a dedicated tab which makes easier the back and forth between the parameter editor and its preview.
* **Reworked preset editor**  
  The way presets are managed in Substance Designer is now much easier and faster: the preset editor has now its dedicated tab and each presets now list which parameters they affect.
* **Visible If is now taking into account for 2D transform gizmos**  
  When a transform 2D gizmo has a Visible If condition, it can now be hidden in the 2D View, making it contextual to the parameters.

### New Content

![](banner-content-8.jpg)

In this version we introduce the new **Atlas Scatter** node. This node allows to read an atlas image (an image containing sub-images) and automatically separate its content into individual component which can then be scattered randomly. This node can be used for example to place branches and leaves on a dirt ground material. [Substance Source](https://source.substance3d.com/allassets?q=atlas) now includes many Atlas materials which can be scattered with this new node.

>[!WARNING]
>
> This release doesn't support CentOS 6.x anymore.  
> On CentOS 7.x the application may not start because of some dependencies issues, to fix the problem either update the system or copy the [following library](https://centos.pkgs.org/7/centos-x86_64/freetype-2.8-12.el7.x86_64.rpm.html) in the installation folder.
