# Version 2020.1 (10.1)

**Substance Designer 2020.1** includes a new shortcut editor, a MaterialX plugin and lots of new improvements for color management with Adobe Color Engine and new bakers functionalities.

Release date: *April 10, 2020*

>[!NOTE]
>
> Starting with this release, the application version number will change its format. What should have been **2020.1** now becomes **10.1.0**.

## Major Features

### New Shortcut Editor for Node Creation

![](banner-shortcuts.png)

In this version we introduce a new shortcut editor which allows to define keyboard shortcuts to speed up the creation of nodes in the different graph modes.

The new shortcut editor is accessible in the main preferences via **Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Shortcuts**. By default every shortcut fields is empty.

* **Shortcuts for each type of graph**   
  It is possible to define a shortcut for each type of graph available in Substance Designer, from regular compositing graph to more advanced such as functions and MDL.

  ![](shortcuts-graph-type.png)
* **Assign shortcuts both for atomic nodes and custom filters**   
  By default the interface shows the atomic nodes for each type of graph. Using the search field allows to refine the list but also make custom library filters and nodes accessible:

  ![](shortcut-node-search.gif)
* **Creating a new shortcut**   
  To create a new shortcut for a specific node simply click in the text field next to its name and type the requested keys on the keyboard. To clear a shortcut use the cross button.

  ![](shortcut-edition.gif)
* **Managing shortcuts conflicts**   
  Use the tooltip on the warning icon to learn more about a conflict. It mentions if a key conflicts with an existing one or if it is already used by the application for an other purpose.

  ![](shortcut-conflict-duplicate.png)

  ![](shortcut-conflict-app.png)
* **Search for shortcuts**   
  In case there are too many shortcuts to track or if a node is not visible by default, use the search system to isolate them:

### New MaterialX Plugin (Beta)

![](banner-materialx.png)

During SIGGRAPH 2019 we demonstrated a MaterialX plugin for Substance Designer. [MaterialX](http://www.materialx.org/) is a format developed by [Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM)](https://www.ilm.com/) that allows artists to create materials that can then be used in a wide variety of platforms and many usages (such as movies, TV shows, games, VR experiences, and manufacturing). This new plugin, which is now available in beta, allows to create MaterialX materials to be used in other compatible DCC application. Take a look at our recent [article about MaterialX](https://magazine.substance3d.com/research-a-portable-shader-graph/) to know more about the process and goals behind this new plugin.

This new plugin allows to:

* Develop procedural shaders and textures in parallel.
* Create advanced shaders for Substance Painter with features such as detail maps and procedural masks changeable at runtime.
* Match shader features from a game engine or VFX pipeline in the Substance Designer and Substance Painter viewport.

To get the plugin, simply head over [Substance Share](https://share.substance3d.com/libraries/6111) to download it.

### New Integration of Adobe Color Engine (ACE)

![](banner-ace-1.jpg)

In addition to OpenColorIO it is now possible to use Adobe Color Engine (ACE) to support ICC profiles for color management. This means you can now import and export calibrated images to match other software such as Photoshop and Illustrator.

* **Enabling Adobe Color Engine**  
  Use the project settings to define which color management system to use:

  ![](color-ace-setting.png)
* **Changing screen profile**  
  When previewing images via the 2D or 3D view, use the dropdown to specify which profile to use:

  ![](color-ace-profile.png)
* **ACES for Legacy Color Management**  
  The ACES tonemapped output transform is now available with the Legacy color management mode.

### Improved Bakers

![](banner-baking-2.jpg)

We refined some of our bakers with two main changes:

* **Improved sampling**  
  The Ambient Occlusion, Thickness and Curvature baker now use a new sampling method which greatly improves the quality of the baked results. It produces a more appealing noise and more stable results, without the need to increase the sample count. The image below shows the previous sampling method at the top and the new method at the bottom with from left to right 4, 8 and 16 samples (all renders were done with anti-aliasing set to 4x4 subsampling).

  ![](bakers-sampling-comparison.jpg){width="600px"}
* **New normalization setting**  
  The Thickness and Heightmap bakers have a new normalization parameter which lets you bake raw values to texture instead of clamped values in the range 0-1. This is useful with a height map to know the raw distances between a low-poly and high-poly mesh for example. The divisor value will correspond exactly to the displacement intensity to setup on the low-poly mesh to match the high-poly mesh silhouette. In order to correctly interpret the height map we have also exposed a new “Scalar Zero Value” parameter to define the pixel value corresponding to 0. Additionally, the manual factor allows to fix potential seam issues on UDIM meshes caused by a per UV-Tile normalization.

### Improved 3D View

![](banner-3dview.jpg)

The 3D view received various quality of life improvements which should make daily work more pleasant:

* **Parameters synchronization between renderers**  
  Shader parameters are now synchronized between OpenGl and Iray which make jumping between them much easier.
* **Display texture input preview and add disable parameter**  
  Shader input parameters now display a preview of their input: it can be a uniform color parameter, a graph node or a bitmap. It is also possible to uncheck a parameter to temporarily disable it.

  ![](3dview-map-preview.png)

  ![](3dview-enable-setting.gif)
* **Environment map preview in settings**  
  When going to **3D View &gt; Environment &gt; Edit** there is now a preview of the environment map used to light the scene.

  ![](3dview-env-settings.jpg)
* **New Unlit shader**  
  A new shader named "unlit" has been included by default. It doesn't react to any lighting and instead can be used to display a single texture in the viewport over a mesh. This is useful to look at baked textures for example.

  ![](3dview-unlit-shader.jpg){width="500px"}
* **Improved performances on High DPI screens with viewport downscaling**  
  Similar to Substance Painter, there is now a new parameter named **Viewport Scaling** in the main preferences that detects that a screen uses HDPI scaling (such as Retina screens on MacOS) and will automatically divide the viewport resolution by 2. This behavior avoids drawing the viewport at too high resolutions and improves general performances.   
  The current setting value are:

  * **None**: no viewport scaling.
  * **Auto** (default): if the application is on a HDPI screen the viewport resolution will be divided by two.

  ![](3dview-hdpi-scaling.png)

### New Content

![](banner-content-7.jpg)

This release also includes some new or improved nodes:

* **Improved PBR Render node**  
  Already introduced in a previous version, this node has been greatly improved. It now offers camera controls, new shapes (such as a plane and a cylinder), post-effects (Depth of Field, Bloom/Glare, Vignette, etc) and new material types (like Clear-Coat and Anisotropy) as well as support for materials with opacity.   
  For more information, see the dedicated [documentation page](../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/material-filters/pbr-utilities/pbr-render/pbr-render.md).

  ![](sphere-forest-gravel.jpg){width="250px"}

  ![](sphere-chesterfield.jpg){width="250px"}

  ![](sherif.jpg){width="250px"}
* **New PBR Render Mapping Node**  
  As an extension for PBR Render, you can use this new node to build composite map-channel previews.  
  For more information, see the dedicated [documentation page](../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/material-filters/pbr-utilities/pbr-render-mapping/pbr-render-mapping.md).

  ![](pbr-render-mapping-ex-2.png){width="250px"}

  ![](pbr-render-mapping-ex.png){width="250px"}
* **New FXAA filter**  
  The new filter implement the Fast approximate anti-aliasing (FXAA) algorithm which is an anti-aliasing method. It can be used on regular texture to smooth out jagged lines or edges.  
  For more information, see the dedicated [documentation page](../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/filters/effects/fxaa/fxaa.md).

  ![](content-fxaa.png){width="600px"}
* **New Hald CLUT filter**  
  This filter allows to adjust the tone and color of an image with an input Look Up Table (LUT). It uses the Hald CLUT format, to create one simply start off from an identity LUT [available here](http://www.quelsolaar.com/technology/clut.html).  
  For more information, see the dedicated [documentation page](../../../compositing-graphs/nodes-reference-for-com/node-library/filters/adjustments/hald-clut/hald-clut.md).
