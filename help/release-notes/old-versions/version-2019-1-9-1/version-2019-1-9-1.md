# Version 2019.1 (9.1)

**Substance Designer 2019.1** brings a new update to the Substance Engine to expand further its capabilities as well as additional new filters.

## Major Features

### New Value Processor Node

![](doc-value-processor.png)

The Substance Engine is now in version 7 and with it brings the new concept of "Values" inside the compositing graph. Values are numbers and not textures and as such can be used to perform various computations that can be shared across nodes via the function graphs and compositing graphs. The Value Processor node can read an input image and compute a single output value.

The Value Processor node is not alone, to be able transit information across graph some changes and additions have been made :

* Output nodes can be directly fed with a value and not necessarily an image anymore.

  ![](doc-output-value.png)
* A new **Input node** named "Input Value" has been added so that graph can query Values.

  ![](doc-input-value.png)
* Nodes now have a new category below their parameters named "Input Values" which can be used to create input values for the node itself.  
  The input values can then be referenced inside the function graph via the "Get" nodes.

>[!NOTE]
>
> As with every major Substance Engine change, the compatibility mode is set to the previous version (new version 6 by default). Which means incompatible nodes will have a yellow border in the graph. To disable/hide the yellow border simply change the engine version in the main settings to the latest version (via the Project settings) :

### Support of Optix in Bakers

![](baking-speed.jpg)

The last update of Substance Designer introduced DXR which allows to perform GPU raytracing on compatible RTX compatible hardware. We now added support for [Optix](https://developer.nvidia.com/optix) which allows to raytrace on other Nvidia's GPUs even under Linux. You can expect baking at least **5 times faster** when using Optix than with regular CPU raytracing.

Here is the list of Bakers affected by this change :

* Ambient Occlusion From Mesh
* Bent Normals From Mesh
* Thickness From Mesh

If you wish to disable one of the two backends, head over to the main preferences (**Edit &gt; Preferences**) and to the Bakers settings :

>[!NOTE]
>
> To access the feature, make sure to **update to the following drivers** :
> 
> * Nvidia 10XX and 20XX GPUs : **drivers 430.39** (compatible with both DXR and Optix)
> * Nvidia 9XX and older : **d** **rivers 419.67 or 430.39** (drivers 425.31 have an issue with Optix)
> 
> Note that DXR is also available on [GeForce GTX 10xx GPUs](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/geforce-gtx-dxr-ray-tracing-available-now/) (with up to date drivers). DXR also requires Windows to be up to date for working, see [this page](../../../best-practices/performance-optimization/performance-optimization-guidelines.md) for more information.

### Improved Loading Times for OBJ Meshes

![](doc-obj-loading.jpg)

In this release we improved our **obj** file reader to reduce the loading time of 3D Meshes. Loading times have been speed up to 3 times, especially for meshes that don't have UVs and Normals defined.

This performance improvement will affect both the Bakers and the 3D View.

### Improved Python Plugin System

![](doc-python.png)

With this update we added a lot of new feature to the scripting system :

* **Support of Qt** : Allows to build custom UI that follows the same style of the rest of the Application. Custom UI can also be integrated much more easily with this new system. (Tkinter is now deprecated.)
* **Callback functions** : It is now possible to register callback functions. At the moment it only includes opening and saving files as well as the creation of UI elements. Additional callbacks will be added in the future.
* **Threading** : Plugins can now create threads to do background processing or wait for OS events (such as network connections).

For further details, take a look at the changelog of the API which can be accessed via the **Help &gt; Python API Documentation** menu entry inside Substance Designer.

### New Content

We also have a few new nodes available in the default library, some of which are now powered with the new Value processor node :

* **Flood Fill To Index**   
  Assigns a unique index to shapes from a Flood Fill node.  
  In the example below the Pixel Processor node matches the Value Input to the shape and output a mask as a result.

  ![](flood-fill-index-optim.gif)
* **Non Uniform Directional Warp**   
  Applies a Directional Warp where the intensity and angle are sampled from image inputs.

  ![](warp-non-uniform-optim.gif)
* **Multi Directional Warp**   
  Warps the input image multiple times into various directions.

  ![](warp-demo.gif)
* **Height Extrude**   
  Generates an orthographic 3D rendering of the given Height. The camera view can be controlled with the position gizmo.

  ![](height-extrude-demo-optim.gif)
* **Min / Max Value**   
  Returns the minimum and maximum pixel value from the input image.

>[!WARNING]
>
> This release doesn't support CentOS 6.x anymore. To use the latest version of Substance Designer please upgrade to CentOS 7.x.
