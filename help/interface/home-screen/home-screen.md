# Home screen

![Home screen](home-screen-home.jpg "Home screen")

The <b>Home screen<b> </b></b>welcomes you when you launch Substance 3D Designer. It helps you get started with your projects and access useful links.

<table>
<tr style="border: 0;">
<td width="100.00%" style="border: 0;" valign="top">

To close the Home Screen, use the <b>Back</b> button on the top left or the <b>Close Home screen</b> button on the bottom left. A checkbox just below lets you toggle the automatic display of the Home screen after starting Designer.

This banner can be collapsed using the ![](home-screen-expand-icon.jpg) <b>Hide suggestions</b> button on the right.

Below, a list of recent files under the <b>Recent</b> header offers quick access to the last loaded projects, from most recent to oldest.

Recent files can be filtered using the <b>Filter</b> input field on the top right of the list. Filtering matches any string of characters present in a project's filename.
