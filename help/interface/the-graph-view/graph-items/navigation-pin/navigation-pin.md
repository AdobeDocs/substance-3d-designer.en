## Creating pins

Pins may be created in any of the following ways:

+++Node menu
Press <b>Spacebar</b> in the Graph view to open the <b>Node menu</b>, and select the 'Pin' item in the list.

Type 'pin' in the search field to surface the item and find it more quickly.

+++

+++Shortcut
If a keyboard shortcut is mapped to the 'Pin' item in the [Preferences](../../../preferences-window/preferences-window.md), press that shortcut when the Graph View has focus.

+++

+++Contextual menu
In the Graph View, press <b>RMB</b> in empty space and select the <b>Add Pin</b> option.

+++

+++Graph toolbar
In the Graph View toolbar, click the 'Pin' button in the <b>Node Palette</b>.

+++

+++Library
In the Library, select the <b>Graph Items</b> category then drag and drop the 'Pin' item into the Graph View.

+++

>[!TIP]
>
> When a pin is created, its 'Description' property automatically gains focus so you can immediately edit the pin's text.

## Jumping to pins

In any graph type, pressing the <b>F2</b> cycles through all pins in that graph in order of creation.

Pins will be framed in the viewport at the current zoom level.
