# Scripting

It is possible to control the application by writing plugins. Plugins can be written in the **Python** scripting language using version **3.9**. The Python API provided in the application allows to access and use many features directly from scripts.

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a scripting language widely used in many industries. It helps build automation, workflow acceleration and asset management tools, among other examples. The API documentation can be accessed from the main menu with **Help** &gt; **Scripting documentation...** action.
