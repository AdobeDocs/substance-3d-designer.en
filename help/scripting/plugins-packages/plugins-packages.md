# Plugins packages

Python packages are supported to create plugins to extend the application.

They are single files with a sdplugin extension containing everything a plugin needs to work. For developers, packages simplify sharing and distributing plugins to users. For users, packages are easier to install and manage.

## Installing plugin packages
