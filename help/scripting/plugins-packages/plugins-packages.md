# Plugins packages

Python packages are supported to create plugins to extend the application.

They are single files with a sdplugin extension containing everything a plugin needs to work. For developers, packages simplify sharing and distributing plugins to users. For users, packages are easier to install and manage.

## Installing plugin packages

Plugin packages are installed using the <b>Plugin Manager</b>, in the <b>Tools</b> menu:

1. Click on the <b>Install</b> button and select the plugin package to install
1. The plugin will be installed in the home directory, in the default path for plugins for each operating system
1. After the plugin is installed, it will be automatically loaded
